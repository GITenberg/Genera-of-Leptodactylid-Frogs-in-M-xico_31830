<h2>Genera of Leptodactylid Frogs in M&eacute;xico</h2>

<p class="center"><b>BY JOHN D. LYNCH</b></p>


<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>According to the most recent review of the Mexican amphibian
fauna (Smith and Taylor, 1948), six genera of leptodactylid frogs
occur in M&eacute;xico. One other genus, <i>Pleurodema</i>, occurs in Lower
Central America. Smith and Taylor recognized one species of <i>Engystomops</i>,
28 of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>, three of <i>Leptodactylus</i>, eight of
<i>Microbatrachylus</i>, 12 of <i>Syrrhophus</i>, and five of <i>Tomodactylus</i>. Subsequent
to the publication of their checklist of the Mexican amphibia
(1948), numerous taxonomic changes have been proposed. Many
species of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> have been added to the fauna, either
through the extension of their recorded ranges into M&eacute;xico from
Guatemala or by the recognition of species unknown in 1948,
whereas some nominal species have been synonymized. <i>Microbatrachylus</i>
has been regarded as synonymous with <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>
(Lynch, 1965); four species of <i>Microbatrachylus</i> currently are
regarded as valid (Duellman, 1961, Lynch, 1965). <i>Syrrhophus</i> was
revised in part by Duellman (1958) and Firschein (1954), and a
species of <i>Tomodactylus</i> transferred to <i>Syrrhophus</i> by Dixon (1957),
who redefined <i>Tomodactylus</i> and added more species to the genus.</p>

<p>Since beginning my studies of the Mexican leptodactylids in 1962,
I have become acutely aware of difficulties involved in defining the
genera. A revision of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> and a review of <i>Syrrhophus</i>
are nearing completion, but prior to their publication it is desirable
to redefine the genera of the Mexican leptodactylids, and in so doing
recognize an heretofore unnamed genus. The definitions of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>
and <i>Leptodactylus</i> may need to be altered in the future,
since both are widespread in South America and occur in the
West Indies. Their definitions as given here are as precise as
present knowledge permits. <i>Syrrhophus</i> and <i>Tomodactylus</i> are
small assemblages that occur only in southwestern United States,
M&eacute;xico, and Guatemala.</p>

<p>Taylor (1952) synonymized <i>Engystomops</i> with <i>Eupemphix</i> which,
although related, should be regarded as generically distinct (Gallardo,
1965). Perhaps the most conservative classification is that of
Myers (1962) who, without published evidence, combined <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
<i>Syrrhophus</i>, and the South American <i>Lithodytes</i> in a
single genus.</p>

<p>The major problem for students working with the Mexican leptodactylids
has not been the separation of <i>Engystomops</i> or <i>Leptodactylus</i>
from other genera but the separation and definition of the
eleutherodactyline frogs currently placed in three genera, <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>,
<i>Syrrhophus</i>, and <i>Tomodactylus</i>. As will be shown in this
paper, these are more conveniently placed in four genera. Once a
fourth genus is recognized, certain phylogenetic problems disappear
and a reasonable zoogeographic interpretation is possible for Middle
American leptodactylid distribution.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="ANALYSIS_OF_CHARACTERS" id="ANALYSIS_OF_CHARACTERS"></a>ANALYSIS OF CHARACTERS</h2>


<p>In M&eacute;xico and northern Central America approximately 55 species
of eleutherodactyline frogs (<i>Eleutherodactylus</i>, <i>Syrrhophus</i>, and
<i>Tomodactylus</i>) are known. Four genera can be recognized on the
basis of the nature of inguinal glands, morphology of the hands and
feet, and certain osteological features.</p>

</p>

<h3>Glands</h3>

<p>Leptodactylids have a variety of glands that have been used as
generic characters. Smith and Taylor (1948) regarded the so-called
inguinal gland as a generic character in Mexican eleutherodaycty-lines.
Lynch (1965) showed that <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> and <i>Microbatrachylus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
cannot be separated by the nature of the gland or the
condition of the prevomers (dentate or not). <i>Syrrhophus</i> and <i>Tomodactylus</i>,
as defined by Smith and Taylor (1948), are not generically
distinct because of overlap in the condition of the prevomers and in
the development of the gland. Firschein (1954) stated that <i>Syrrhophus</i>
differed from <i>Tomodactylus</i> by having an axillary gland,
but it is now known that one species of <i>Syrrhophus</i> lacks the gland.</p>

<p>The inguinal glands of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> and <i>Syrrhophus</i>, if present,
are diffuse, irregular in outline, and generally not prominent;
in <i>Tomodactylus</i> the gland is higher on the body (a lumbo-inguinal
gland), compact, oval in outline, and prominent (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). Axillary
glands occur in most <i>Syrrhophus</i> but are not known in <i>Tomodactylus</i>
or <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>.</p>


<h3>Hands and feet</h3>

<p>The tips of the digits are laterally expanded in most <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>,
<i>Syrrhophus</i>, and <i>Tomodactylus</i>. Two species of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>
(<i>augusti</i> and <i>tarahumarensis</i>) and two <i>Tomodactylus</i> (<i>angustidigitorum</i>
and <i>grandis</i>) lack any expansion of the digital tips.
All but two of the species of eleutherodactyline frogs (<i>E. augusti</i>
and <i>E. tarahumarensis</i>) have a transverse groove across the tips of
the digits (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>Supernumerary tubercles rarely are present on the feet of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>,
but are present and numerous in every species of
<i>Syrrhophus</i>, <i>Tomodactylus</i>, and in the members of the <i>augusti</i> group
of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>). The tubercles are small and numerous
in <i>Syrrhophus</i> and larger in <i>Tomodactylus</i> and the <i>Eleutherodactylus
augusti</i> group. Most species of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> have no
plantar supernumerary tubercles; a few species have such tubercles,
which never extend between the metatarsal tubercles as in <i>Syrrhophus</i>
and <i>Tomodactylus</i>.</p>

</p>

<p>Tarsal folds and tubercles are lacking in <i>Syrrhophus</i>, <i>Tomodactylus</i>,
and the <i>augusti</i> group of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>. Several species of
<i>Eleutherodactylus</i> lack tarsal folds and tubercles, but in nearly
every species group, one or more species possess either an inner
tarsal fold, inner tarsal tubercle(s), or outer tarsal tubercles.</p>

<p>The terminal phalanges of <i>Syrrhophus</i>, <i>Tomodactylus</i>, and all
<i>Eleutherodactylus</i> (except the frogs of the <i>augusti</i> group) are distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
T-shaped. In the latter, the bones are knob-shaped distally
(<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>). T-shaped terminal phalanges also are present in <i>Lithodytes</i>
and <i>Trachyphrynus</i> but not in other leptodactylid genera. At
least one species of <i>Eupsophus</i> (<i>E. quixensis</i>) has terminal phalanges
that resemble those of the <i>Eleutherodactylus augusti</i> group.
Several species of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>, <i>Syrrhophus</i>, and <i>Tomodactylus</i>
with slender fingers have T-shaped terminal phalanges although the
terminal dilations proportionately are only scarcely wider than the
finger tips in the <i>Eleutherodactylus augusti</i> group. The presence of
a terminal groove at the tip of the finger is an external indicator of
the T-shaped terminal phalanges.</p>

<h3>Skull</h3>

<p>All Mexican eleutherodactyline frogs have quadratojugal-maxillary
articulations, completely roofed skulls in adults, median contact of
the nasals, separated occipital condyles, and large prevomers. The
premaxillae of all species are visible when the skulls are viewed from
directly above. The pterygoid lacks a medioventral flange and does
not meet the palatine. In no species is the anterior arm of the
squamosal in contact with the maxillary. Of the numerous species
examined (30 <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>, four <i>Syrrhophus</i>, and four <i>Tomodactylus</i>),
the species in the <i>Eleutherodactylus augusti</i> group are
unique in having a sphenethmoid with a blunt anterior edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span></p>
<h3>Pectoral Girdle</h3>

<p>All species have large cartilaginous plates in the pectoral girdles;
none possesses a bony style. No divergent modifications of the
clavicle and coracoid bones are known in the family.</p>

<h2><a name="DISCUSSION" id="DISCUSSION"></a>DISCUSSION</h2>


<p>The preceding definitions only slightly alter the present generic
limits of Mexican leptodactylids. Two species, previously regarded
as <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>, are transferred to the new genus <i>Hylactophryne</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
The arrangement of the species of <i>Syrrhophus</i> and <i>Tomodactylus</i>
remains the same as concluded by Dixon (1957), Duellman
(1958), and Firschein (1954) in their reviews of the genera.</p>

<p>Lumbo-inguinal glands are most prominent in the genera <i>Pleurodema</i>
and <i>Tomodactylus</i>. Various nondescript glands are present
in many genera, but none is so well developed as those of <i>Pleurodema</i>
and <i>Tomodactylus</i>.</p>

<p>At least nine leptodactylid genera are either known or thought to
be terrestrial breeders lacking a free-living tadpole stage (<i>Eleutherodactylus</i>,
<i>Euparkerella</i>, <i>Hylactophryne</i>, <i>Niceforonia</i>, <i>Noblella</i>,
<i>Sminthillus</i>, <i>Syrrhophus</i>, <i>Tomodactylus</i> and <i>Trachyphrynus</i>). <i>Niceforonia</i>
and <i>Trachyphrynus</i>, and probably <i>Hylactophryne</i>, are not
closely related to the other genera. Direct development probably
is an adaptation to adverse environmental conditions since many of
the species occur in semi-arid or cold (Andean p&aacute;ramos) areas.
<i>Eleutherodactylus</i> is generally thought to be the stock from which
<i>Euparkerella</i>, <i>Noblella</i>, and <i>Sminthillus</i> evolved (Griffiths, 1959)
and from which <i>Syrrhophus</i> and <i>Tomodactylus</i> are derived (Firschein,
1954).</p>

<p>The present distribution of <i>Hylactophryne</i> (isolated on the Mexican
Plateau) and its digital form (like that of Papuan and many
primitive South American leptodactylids) suggest that the genus
was isolated in M&eacute;xico throughout the Tertiary, whereas the other
Central American genera are either post-Pliocene derivatives of
<i>Eleutherodactylus</i> or invaders of Central America from South America
since the mid-Pliocene land bridge was formed (Lloyd, 1963).</p>

<p>Piatt (1934) presented arguments against assigning <i>Eleutherodactylus
latrans</i> to the genus <i>Lithodytes</i> and concluded that it was a
"true" <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>. Contrary to his arguments, <i>latrans</i>
(= <i>augusti</i> of Zweifel) and <i>E. tarahumarensis</i> Taylor differ from
all other <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> (and <i>Syrrhophus</i> and <i>Tomodactylus</i>)
in the nature of the tips of the digits (external and skeletal). The
digits of <i>Hylactophryne</i> are like those of <i>Eupsophus</i>. My study of
nearly all genera of leptodactylids indicates that Noble (1925) was
correct in suggesting that <i>Borborocoetes</i> (= <i>Eupsophus</i>) is a close
relative of <i>Eleutherodactylus latrans</i>, although Noble's arguments
were based in part upon false evidence concerning the breeding
habits of <i>E. latrans</i>, then thought to have a free-living tadpole.</p>

<p>Kellogg (1932) and Piatt (1934) argued that the terminal phalanges
of <i>E. latrans</i> were typically eleutherodactyline. The variation
of this character in <i>Eupsophus</i> (see <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>) ranges from
knobbed to bifurcate or Y-shaped (T-shaped in <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
<i>Syrrhophus</i> and <i>Tomodactylus</i>) and encompasses the nature of the
character represented in <i>Hylactophryne</i>. <i>Eupsophus</i> differs from
<i>Hylactophryne</i> in possessing a frontoparietal fontanelle, in generally
having a maxillary-quadratojugal gap, and in having a free swimming
tadpole stage.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
